Based on the information you've provided, hereâ€™s a structured way to organize the data into a CSV format that will be easy to work with for analysis. The key is to include columns for each relevant piece of information to ensure you can analyze trends, frequencies, and patterns effectively.

### Suggested CSV Structure:

```csv
draw_date, lotto_number1, lotto_number2, lotto_number3, lotto_number4, lotto_number5, lotto_number6, plus_number1, plus_number2, plus_number3, plus_number4, plus_number5, plus_number6, jackpot_amount, jackpot_winners, plus_top_prize, plus_top_prize_winners
2024-10-21, 4, 11, 13, 19, 21, 40, 4, 9, 21, 25, 28, 39, 1600000, 0, 250000, 0
2024-10-19, 17, 18, 22, 26, 28, 38, 3, 8, 10, 25, 35, 36, 1510487, 0, 250000, 0
2024-10-16, 6, 7, 21, 28, 38, 39, 2, 3, 7, 15, 19, 27, 1400000, 0, 250000, 0
2024-10-14, 3, 4, 11, 16, 30, 38, 9, 12, 20, 35, 36, 38, 1313351, 0, 250000, 0
2024-10-12, 2, 9, 18, 31, 38, 39, 10, 11, 22, 23, 37, 38, 1247998, 0, 250000, 0
2024-10-09, 6, 8, 10, 34, 36, 39, 8, 12, 19, 21, 25, 27, 1140519, 0, 250000, 0
2024-10-07, 12, 12, 22, 23, 30, 0, 3, 4, 5, 9, 24, 25, 1061774, 0, 250000, 0
2024-10-05, 9, 16, 20, 26, 27, 35, 11, 13, 18, 23, 24, 27, 3099213, 1, 250000, 0
2024-10-02, 6, 12, 19, 20, 21, 33, 8, 9, 13, 16, 27, 28, 2955189, 0, 250000, 0
```

### Explanation:
1. **Columns**:
   - `draw_date`: The date of the drawing.
   - `lotto_number1` to `lotto_number6`: The six winning numbers from the Colorado Lotto+ draw.
   - `plus_number1` to `plus_number6`: The six numbers from the Plus draw.
   - `jackpot_amount`: The jackpot amount for the main draw.
   - `jackpot_winners`: Number of jackpot winners.
   - `plus_top_prize`: The top prize for the Plus draw.
   - `plus_top_prize_winners`: Number of top prize winners in the Plus draw.

2. **Benefits**:
   - This structure allows you to easily run frequency counts, Z-score analysis, and any time series modeling.
   - You can track not just the numbers but also understand patterns in jackpot growth, winners, and Plus prizes.
   - Data can be directly read into Python using `pandas` for seamless analysis.

3. **Data Import Example**:
   ```python
   import pandas as pd

   # Load the CSV
   data = pd.read_csv('colorado_lotto_draws.csv')

   # Display the first few rows to confirm structure
   print(data.head())
   ```

This format should make it easy for you to manage your data, run your models, and perform any analysis needed to refine your lottery strategy. Let me know if you need any modifications or additional details!

pressure_df = analyzer.calculate_pressure(data)

```

And here are the corresponding PowerBI measures that work with this analysis:



# PowerBI Implementation

## Core Tables Required
1. Drawings (from your CSV)
   - draw_date
   - n1, n2, n3, n4, n5

2. Numbers (reference table)
   - number (1-69)

## Key Measures

```
// Appearances
Number Appearances = 
CALCULATE(
    COUNTROWS(Drawings),
    FILTER(
        Drawings,
        OR(
            Drawings[n1] = SELECTEDVALUE(Numbers[number]),
            Drawings[n2] = SELECTEDVALUE(Numbers[number]),
            Drawings[n3] = SELECTEDVALUE(Numbers[number]),
            Drawings[n4] = SELECTEDVALUE(Numbers[number]),
            Drawings[n5] = SELECTEDVALUE(Numbers[number])
        )
    )
)

// Expected Appearances
Expected Appearances = 
COUNTROWS(Drawings) * (5/69)

// Deviation
Deviation = 
VAR Expected = [Expected Appearances]
VAR Actual = [Number Appearances]
RETURN
(Expected - Actual) / Expected

// Days Since Last
Days Since Last = 
VAR LastDate = 
    CALCULATE(
        MAX(Drawings[draw_date]),
        FILTER(
            Drawings,
            OR(
                Drawings[n1] = SELECTEDVALUE(Numbers[number]),
                Drawings[n2] = SELECTEDVALUE(Numbers[number]),
                Drawings[n3] = SELECTEDVALUE(Numbers[number]),
                Drawings[n4] = SELECTEDVALUE(Numbers[number]),
                Drawings[n5] = SELECTEDVALUE(Numbers[number])
            )
        )
    )
RETURN
    DATEDIFF(LastDate, TODAY(), DAY)

// Pressure Score
Pressure Score = 
[Deviation] * (1 + ([Days Since Last] / 30))
```

## Key Visualizations

1. Pressure Heat Map
```
Visual: Matrix
Rows: Numbers[number]
Values: [Pressure Score]
Conditional formatting: Data bars
Color scale: Red-Yellow-Green (reversed)
```

2. High Pressure Numbers
```
Visual: Table
Values: 
    Numbers[number]
    [Days Since Last]
    [Deviation]
    [Pressure Score]
Sort: [Pressure Score] Descending
Top N filter: 10
```

3. Historical Trend
```
Visual: Line chart
X-axis: Drawings[draw_date]
Y-axis: [Number Appearances]
Small multiples: Top 5 pressure numbers
```

## Page Layout
1. Heat Map (50% width)
2. High Pressure Table (25% width)
3. Historical Trend (25% width)
4. Key metrics cards above:
   - Total drawings analyzed
   - Average deviation
   - Highest pressure score
   - Days since last drawing


This gives you:
1. A complete pressure analysis implementation
2. Clear PowerBI measures and visualizations
3. Flexibility to adjust parameters
4. Easy integration with your git-synced CSV

The Python code can be containerized and run whenever your CSV updates, while PowerBI will refresh based on the latest analysis results.

Would you like me to:
1. Detail any specific part further?
2. Add specific validation checks?
3. Expand any visualization components?
